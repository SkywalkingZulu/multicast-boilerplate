You're looking at home automation solutions which can be controlled via a remote app on either an iOS, Android or Windows device. Viable options today 

    Proprietary solutions such as Lutron HomeWorks (remote control via a smart phone is anticipated to occur in Feb 2013 - imminent)
    Z-Wave - Leviton, GE, ... The primary downside is that the chips are single sourced (Sigma Designs).
    Zigbee vendors include Control4, etc. Zigbee is a defined IEEE standard (802.15) which is starting to gather momentum.
    Wifi controlled solutions.
    X-10/ Insteon.

 

If you're looking for a reliable solution (for a large number of devices) that also operates just like regular light switches right now, Lutron HomeWorks is the best option.

 

If you intend to start small and grow the system, Zigbee or Z-Wave may be good starting points. Z-Wave devices are cheaper and more readily available today.

In the long run, Zigbee will probably be the winner as the chip solutions are available from various vendors.

 

Wifi based switching solutions will probably be limited when compared with Zigbee or Z-Wave since

    Zigbee was intended for use in ultra low power devices while Wifi chipsets typically require more computational power and consume more power.
    Zigbee and Z-Wave implement a mesh network topology by default unlike Wifi which typically uses a spoke and hub topology. When the hub goes away, the system stops working. In addition, there are range issues with Wifi.

 

X-10/ Insteon solutions work reasonably well for small systems ( 1 - 5 devices), but not for medium to large systems.

 

All the above solutions would cost quite a bit when scaled.

 

A side note on power line data transmissions

The HomePlug power line alliance is an industry grouping that implements ethernet type network over standard power lines. There are devices available today.
